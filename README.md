# TODO
Include:
- Business Story 

~~Scratch this~~
- What is the content of "Part 1" folder
    - How to run the code
- A paragraph on: How do we respond to our steakholders
    - We started testing different algorithms using the surprise package. KNN the Prob MF
    - We decided to go with Prob MF and wrote our own implementations so that we can have 
    a deeper control over the algorithm
    - Recomendataion: We do not recommend using the surprise package because ????
    - Lingering questions: 
        - Why does our implementation provide results with lower RMSE and MAE
        - Why should we build our own algorithm vs just use the surprise package
        - Why did we choose Prob MF?
        - When will the algorithm give bad predictions? and when will it give good predictions


## Hypothetical Business Story
The support team at Netflix has started to receive user complains about Netflix having a limiting
selection of movies. As a response to this the product team has decided that they want to suggest
similar movies as a consolation to users that can't find their desired movie. The product team has
asked their top two data scientist, Debbie and Juan Carlos, to create an algorithm that allows a user
to receive suggested movies when the searched is not available.


## Steakholders
1. Product Team: This team has requested the ability to provide a user with suggest movies when the user is not able to find the specific movie they want to watch.
2. Support Team: This team expects that the new feature will reduce the number of user complains about the movies not being available on their library.

## Success Metrics
* The number of users complains related to a movie not being available should statistically significantdecrease after the feature is implemented.
* The number of people that watch any movie suggested after it is presented to them should increase while the number of user complains decreases.


## Part 1 directory:
* Instruction to running version one of the algorithm...?!?!?!?!
* The approach to the development of version 1 of the algorithm has been detailed in the notebooks and README files located in the “Part 1” subdirectory.
