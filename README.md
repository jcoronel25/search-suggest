# Using Collaborative Filtering to Recommend Alternative Movies

## Case Study
The customer service team at Netflix has started to receive user complaints about Netflix having a limited catalog of movies. In response, the product team has decided that they want to suggest similar movies as a consolation to users that can't find their desired movie. The product team has asked their top two data scientist, Debbie and Juan Carlos, to create an algorithm that allows a user to receive suggested movies when their searched for movie is not available.


## Stakeholders
1. Product Team: This team has requested the ability to provide a user with suggested movies when the user is not able to find the specific movie they want to watch.
2. Customer Service Team: This team expects that the new feature will reduce the number of user complains about the movies not being available on their library.

## Success Metrics
* The number of user complaints related to a movie not being available should show statistically significant decreases after the feature is implemented.
* The number of people that watch a recommended movie should increase while the number of user complaints decreases.


## Part 1 directory:
* Instruction to running version one of the algorithm...?!?!?!?!
* The approach to the development of version 1 of the algorithm has been detailed in the notebooks and README files located in the “Part 1” subdirectory.
